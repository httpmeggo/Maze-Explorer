# Maze-Explorer
This is program that uses data structures, stack and queue, to explore a maze and, hopefully, find a way out of it. There are many algorithms that use different data structures and different strategies to explore mazes. In this assignment I tried two such approaches. In both of these approaches I start from some initial position within the maze and evaluate the neighboring spaces until either I find a way out, or I discover that there is no way out. The rough outline of both approaches is to examine spaces around the current position and decide which need to be examined further and which definitely do not lead to an exit (more details below in the algorithm description).


Main goal: the main goal of this programming project is to get out of a maze.

The other goal of this programming project is for me master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:

- working with multi-file programs
- writing classes
- implementing existing interfaces
- working with existing code
- implementing your own doubly linked list
- implementing your own stack and queue
